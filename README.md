Desfire card library for Python

WARNING
=======

Project still ongoing, use it with caution!

Features
========

-   Compatible with all readers supported by pySCARD

-   Pure python implementation

-   One of the few DESFire libraries that supports ALL (DES,2DES,3DES,AES)
    authentication types

-   Enumeration of the card gives an overlook on how the card is structured

Issues
======

-   CMAC calculation fails (this causes the IV for the session key to lose sync
    with the IV on the card)

-   Encrypted communication is not implemented (need to fix CMAC first)

-   Canâ€™t read data from certain file types

-   Some commands are missing (since there is no full documentation available)
